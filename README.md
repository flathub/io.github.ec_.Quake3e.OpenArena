## This is the Flatpak for OpenARENA, it uses Quake3e as its engine and has some bug fixes over the original version.
- The wrapper script is configurable. Launch from the terminal and see the messages in red (when you launch for the first time).
    - It allows you to load mods, or entirely different games based on Q3, you can also append new CVARS by simply adding +set at the end of the flatpak run command.
